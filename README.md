### PIVOT POINT ANALYSIS
A pivot point is a technical analysis indicator, or calculations, used to determine the overall trend of the market over different time frames. 
Pivot points are an intraday indicator for trading futures, commodities, and stocks. Unlike moving averages or oscillators, they are static and remain at the same prices throughout the day.
